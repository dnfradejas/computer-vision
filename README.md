# Description
Some projects involve techniques in computer vision including image enhancement and image stitching.

## Image Enhancement
* Application of OpenCV image processing techniques including thresholding, gaussian blur, gamma adjustment, and etc.

## Image Stitching
* Stitching images using SIFT and RANSAC.
* Easier way of stitching using OpenCV function: `cv2.Sticher_create()`
